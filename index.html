        <p>
          <b>Cricket</b> is a <a href="#">bat-and-ball C</a> played between two
          teams of eleven players on a <a href="#">field</a> at the centre of
          which is a 22-yard (20-metre) <a href="#">pitch</a> with a
          <a href="#">wicket</a> at each end, each comprising two
          <a href="#">bails</a> balanced on <a href="#">three stumps</a>. The
          <a href="#">batting</a> side scores runs by striking the ball bowled
          at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while
          the <a href="#">bowling</a> and <a href="#">fielding</a> side tries to
          prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and
          getting the ball to either wicket) and <a href="#">dismiss</a> each
          batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being
          <a href="#">bowled</a>, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges
          the bails, and by the fielding side either
          <a href="#">catching</a> the ball after it is hit by the bat, but
          before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a
          batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters
          have been dismissed, the <a href="#">innings</a> ends and the teams
          swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two <a href="#">umpires</a>,
          aided by a <a href="#">third umpire</a> and
          <a href="#">match referee</a> in international matches. They
          communicate with two off-field <a href="#">scorers</a> who record the
          match's
          <a href="#">statistical information.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="#">Forms of cricket</a> range from <a href="#">Twenty20</a>,
          with each team batting for a single innings of 20
          <a href="#">overs</a>, to <a href="#">Test matches</a> played over
          five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white
          <a href="#">kit</a>, but in <a href="#">limited overs cricket</a> they
          wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players
          wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a
          hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised
          sewn seam enclosing a <a href="#">cork</a> core layered with tightly
          wound string.

          The earliest reference to cricket is in
          <a href="#">South East England</a> in the mid-16th century. It spread
          globally with the expansion of the <a href="#">British Empire</a>,
          with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th
          century. The game's governing body is the
          <a href="#">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC), which has over
          100 members, twelve of which are <a href="#">full members</a> who play
          Test matches. The game's rules, the <a href="#">Laws of Cricket</a>,
          are maintained by <a href="#">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) in
          <a href="#">London</a>. The sport is followed primarily in the
          <a href="#">Indian subcontinent</a>, Australasia, the United Kingdom,
          <a href="#">southern Africa</a> and the
          <a href="#">West Indies</a>.<sup>[1]</sup>
          <a hfref="#">Women's cricket</a>, which is organised and played
          separately, has also achieved international standard. The most
          successful side playing <a hfref="#">international cricket</a> is
          <a hfref="#">Australia</a>, which has won seven
          <a hfref="#">One Day International trophies</a>, including five
          <a hfref="#">World Cups</a>, more than any other country and has been
          the <a hfref="#">top-rated Test side</a> more than any other country.
